2.What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?

==>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

    .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
    .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
    .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint

The table below illustrates how each container’s max-width compares to the original .container and .container-fluid across each breakpoint.

4.What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?

==>Use our powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.
How it works

Bootstrap’s .thumbnail class is used to show linked images in grids (grid system), a thumbnail is created using class .thumbnail within the element <a>.
